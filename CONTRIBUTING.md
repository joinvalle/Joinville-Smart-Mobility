# Report issues
If you have any issue with The Project, sorry about that, but we will do what we
can to fix that. Actually, maybe we already have, so first thing to do is to
update The Project and see if the bug is still there.



# Make a pull request
We gladly accept pull request on the [official
repository](https://github.com/GabrielBogo/Joinville-Smart-Mobility) for new rules, new features, bug
fixes, etc.
